The practice of extracting and comprehending information from natural text and images.

# Text Intelligence

Today large amounts of knowledge is stored in machine-readable forms such as text. Conversational agents are bcoming more important in human-computer communication and even human-human communication relies on machines.

Whithin the discipline of natural language processing the following terms are defined as:

- Linguistics: How words, phrases, and sentences are formed.
- Phsycolinguistics: How people understand and communicate using human language.
- Compuational linguistics: Models and computational aspects of natural language processing.
- Phoenetics: How words are related to the sound they make.
- Morphological knowledge: Knowledge of how words are constructed.
- Syntactic Knowledge: Knowledge of how words can form correct sentences, and their roles within them.
- Semantic Knowledge: Knowledge of the meaning of words and sentences.
- Pragmatic Knowledge: Knowledge of how sentences are used in different contexts.
- Discourse Knowledge: Knowledge of how meaning is changed by previous sentences.

The extraction of meaning from text is made complex by ambiguity. In general there are 4 approaches to accounting for ambiguity:

1. Tightly coupling the levels of processing, allowing the knowledge at one level to inform the ambiguity at another.
2. Pipeline processing (loosely coupled stages) that ignores ambiguity, assuming an incorrect structure will be eliminated by another level.
3. Probabalistic approaches that decide the probability of semantics by the surrounding words, choosing the most likely candidate.
4. Ignore ambiguity entirely, assuming it plays no role in the sentences given.
