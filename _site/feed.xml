&lt;p&gt;This site serves as a collection of notes and information I have written on a variety of computer science, mathematics, and tehcnolgoical subjects. Currently there is a roughly even split between topics taken from university papers and those I have covered personally. Topics are hopefully written as clearly as possible. I expect the layout of the site to change over time as I try to frakenstien some elements like page contents and searching together. With that being said I hope you find some useful information.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Miscellaneous" /><summary type="html">This is the first entry made after migrating from my own web server to jekyll, so I thought I would write a post instead of the regular pages I write.</summary></entry></feed>
