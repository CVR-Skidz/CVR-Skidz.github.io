<h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>An organized collection of data stored an accessed electronically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Databases evolved from file systems. Access to data is handled through a <a href="#DBMS">DBMS</a>.</p>

<p>Databases contain two fundamental types of data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>End-User:</strong> raw data of interest to the user</li>
  <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> data that provides information about other data</li>
</ul>

<p>Databases can be centralized, distributed, or cloud-based. Additionally they can be operational (day-to-day operations) or analytical (archiving and analysis needs)</p>

<h3 id="file-systems">File Systems</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A collection of files managed by an agent and an associated program</p>
</blockquote>

<p>File systems were the fundamental means to store data, and were prone to data redundancy. This then leads to updating multiple files to update data and is prone to error.</p>

<ul>
  <li>File systems do not contain relationships between records.</li>
  <li>File systems struggle to maintain concurrent file manipulation. This is a write not a read issue.</li>
  <li>File systems require multiple programs to manage data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dbms">DBMS</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>A collection of software that manages the database structure and controls access to the stored data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is a DBMS?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set of software to access/manage data inside a database</li>
  <li>A collection of interrelated data held by an entity</li>
</ul>

<table>

      <th>Description</th>

<p>A database system is made of a DBMS and database.</p>

<h2 id="data-models">Data Models</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>An abstraction of a collection of related concepts used to describe the structure of a database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Data modelling is the process of creating a data model for a problem domain. There are three categories of data models:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Model</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Conceptual</td>
      <td><strong>Relationships between tables</strong> close to how the user perceives tables</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Logical</td>
      <td>A design implementable in a database, <strong>a technical design of the database</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Internal/Physical</td>
      <td><strong>The implementation of the logical model</strong>, how the data is stored</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>The internal model contains the implementation of a logical model, in a SQL database this would be the SQL used to create the database.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../Assets/DB_Design/DB_Models.png" alt="How the models relate to each other" /></p>

<h3 id="schemas">Schemas</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A schema used to describe a database</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A database consists of the following schema under the three level architecture:</p>

<ul>
  <li>External (an instance of a conceptual model similar to a use case)</li>
  <li>Conceptual</li>
  <li>Internal/Physical</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="three-level-architecture">Three Level Architecture</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Changes made at different levels of a database (conceptual, logical, physical) should nor impact one another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The three level architecture defines that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All users should be able to access same data.</li>
  <li>Users need not know how the database is implemented.</li>
  <li>changes to a schema does not affect any other.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mappings between schemas are required so that a query at the highest level can be retrieved by the database at the lowest level. These mappings are what allows a schema to be independently changed, known as <strong>data independence</strong></p>

<h2 id="data-independence">Data Independence</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Isolating changes to database schemas</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../Assets/DB_Design/three_level_arch.png" alt="Three Level Architecture" /></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Independence Level</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Logical independence</td>
      <td>Changes to the conceptual schema do not impact external views</td>
      <td>An application or query is based off an external view, hence changing the conceptual schema do not break applications or queries already accessing the database</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Physical independence</td>
      <td>Changes to the internal schema have no impact on conceptual models</td>
      <td>The application does not need to know how or where the database has stored the data, but just how to ask for it. For example changing between a DBMS does not break the database</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="relational-models">Relational models</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>A relational model is a logical rather than physical model of a database</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A relational model will model tables, which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is a 2d structure containing rows and columns</li>
  <li>Resembles a file conceptually</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Although 1:1 and 1:Many relationships can be implemented in a relational model, a Many:Many can not</strong>. To get around this we use tow 1:Many relationships between a bridging table.</p>

<p><img src="../Assets/DB_Design/Many_To_Many.png" alt="M:M" /></p>

<p>Within a relational model keys are used to ensure each row is uniquely identifiable. Keys are based on the concept of determination, where I can determine the value of another attribute based on another. For example if I know an ID I can determine the name of the person who has that ID, this means the name is functionally dependant on the ID.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One attribute can be dependent on multiple other attributes (e.g. ID, CourseID -&gt; Grade), hence a key can consist of more than one attribute.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="keys">Keys</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Primary</td>
      <td>One or more attributes used to uniquely identify a row</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Secondary Key</td>
      <td>An attribute used in queries that is guaranteed to be unique</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Foreign key</td>
      <td>An attribute in one table who’s value matches the primary key in a related table, or is NULL</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Entity integrity:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Primary keys can not be NULL</li>
  <li>Each primary key must be unique</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Referential Integrity:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A foreign key ensures there is a machine record stored somewhere else in the database. (e.g. If a grade is added to a student ID that does not exist there is an error)</li>
  <li>A foreign key can not be deleted unless there are no records that depend on it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Determination:</strong> The state of knowing an attribute based on another.</p>

<h3 id="joins">Joins</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Types of intersection operations</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Equijoin: Find two common columns between tables <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT * FROM tablea, tableb WHERE tablea.a = tableb.b;</code> <strong>Uses an equality operator</strong></li>
  <li>Outer join: Include values which are not present in both tables as well <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT * FROM tablea, tableb WHERE tablea.a(+) = tableb.missing_attribute;</code>
    <ul>
      <li>Include a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(+)</code> on the side where the value is missing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Self join: Joining a table to itself to use a foreign key as a primary key present in the same table.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="entity-relationship-diagrams">Entity Relationship Diagrams</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Expresses the logical structure of a database by the relationship between entities</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>An ERD communicates the requirements of a database between different users (end users, developers etc.).</li>
  <li>An ERD communicates the domain of a database.</li>
  <li>Nouns are used to identify entities and verbs identify relationships.</li>
</ul>

<p>Entities are distinguishable between each other, and can be described by a set of attributes which are either required or optional. The domain refers to the possible values these attributes can be.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Identifiers</strong> refer to attributes that can identify an instance of an entity.</li>
  <li>Composite attributes can be divided into multiple simple attributes (e.g. a phone number has an area code, exchange number, and a four digit number).</li>
  <li>Simple attributes can not be subdivided.</li>
  <li>Attributes which can have multiple values are called multi-value. (E.g. an employee can have many phone numbers)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../Assets/DB_Design/Attribute_Diagram.png" alt="Attributes in ERD(s)" /></p>

<h3 id="erd-relationships">ERD Relationships</h3>

<p>Entities also contain relationships between one another. Each relationship has a connectivity (multiplicity). This can be 1:1, 1:Many, or Many:Many. A cardinality may also specify the maximum number of relationships an entity can have (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(1,4)</code> describes 1 entity <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> can have a relation with 4 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code> entities).</p>

<ul>
  <li>A relationship <strong>has</strong> to be bidirectional</li>
  <li>The participation of a relationship specifies whether an entity must have a relationship of this type.</li>
  <li>A relationship can involve multiple entities, this is called the relationship degree</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Degree</th>
      <th>Number of Entities</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Unary</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Self-relation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Binary</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>One entity relates to another</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ternary</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>One entity relates to two others</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>A relationship is specified by the following syntax:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{Entity_1} {Participation} {Verb} {Multiplicity} {Entity_2} where {Query}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STUDENT may have many ENROLLMENT</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STUDENT must have at least one LECTURER</code></p>

<p>Participation and cardinality is visualized with the following symbols.</p>

<p><img src="../Assets/DB_Design/Crows_Feet.png" alt="Crows Feet" /></p>

<h3 id="dependency">Dependency</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Entities that only exist when another entity exists in a database are dependent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dependency describes the conditions for an entity to exist in a database, this can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Existence Dependant: The entity only exists when it is associated with another entity that also exists within the database, known as weak existence.</li>
  <li>Existence Independent: The entity exists regardless of if it’s related entities exist in the database. Known as a strong entity.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <strong>weak</strong> relation is said to occur when the primary key of the related entity does not contain a component (a part of a value) from the parents primary key. When the related key does contain a component of the parents primary key this is called a <strong>strong</strong> relationship.</p>

<p><strong>A weak entity must be existence dependant and have a strong relation to the other entity</strong>. A strong entity must be existence independent and have a weak relation.</p>

<h3 id="associative-entities">Associative Entities</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>AKA bridge entity, associative entities are used to create Many:Many relationships.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An associative entity creates a M:M relation by being in a 1:M relation with both parents. It must contain the primary key of both parents.</p>

<p><img src="../Assets/DB_Design/Associative_Entity.png" alt="Example" /></p>

<h2 id="extended-entity-relationships">Extended Entity Relationships</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Adding additional semantics such as sub and super types to an ERD is called an EER (Extended Entity Relationship)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EERDs are conceptual models.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Subtype: A specialization of a supertype that provides additional attributes or relationships.</li>
  <li>Supertype: A generic entity type that has a relationship with one or more subtypes</li>
</ul>

<p>Attribute Inheritance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Subtype entities inherit values of all attributes of the supertype</li>
  <li>An instance of a subtype is also an instance of the supertype</li>
  <li>Relationships are also inherited from supertypes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="completeness-constraints">Completeness Constraints</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Completeness constraints specify whether an instance of a supertype must be an instance of a subtype as well. (The subtype eg. student must be a specific type of student as well)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Partial completeness</p>

<ul>
  <li>Symbolized by a circle over a single line</li>
  <li>An instance of the supertype does NOT have to be a member of a subtype</li>
</ul>

<p>Total completeness</p>

<ul>
  <li>Symbolized by a circle over a double line</li>
  <li>Every supertype occurrence must be member of at least one subtype</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="disjoint-constraints">Disjoint Constraints</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Disjoint constraints specify whether a supertype instance can be an instance of more than one subtype.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Disjoint rule: A supertype must be an instance of only one subtype. This is indicated by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d</code> inside the circle of a completeness constraint.</li>
  <li>Overlap rule: A supertype may be an instance of more than one subtype. This is indicated by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o</code> inside the circle of a completeness constraint.</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Disjoint</th>
      <th>Overlap</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../Assets/DB_Design/disjoint.png" alt="disjoint" /></td>

<h2 id="normalisation">Normalisation</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>A tool to validate and improve a logical design so that it meets certain requirements without duplicating data, such as CRUD.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often a design may contain anomalies that cause CRUD functions to cause inconsistency in data. Anomalies can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Insertion Anomaly: adding new rows forces user to create duplicate data. For instance if to add a new product I had to add a new order.</li>
  <li>Deletion Anomaly: deleting rows may cause a loss of data that would be needed for other future rows</li>
  <li>Modification Anomaly: changing data in a row forces changes to other rows because of duplication</li>
</ul>

<p>Normalisation goes through forms to remove these issues. Generally 1st, 2cnd, and 3rd normal forms are performed.</p>

<p><img src="../Assets/DB_Design/Normal_Forms.png" alt="Normal Forms" /></p>

<h2 id="transaction-management">Transaction Management</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Managing units of work inside a database</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A transaction changes the contents of a database, they must be either committed (applied), or rolled back (aborted). A transaction can consist of many statements, a transaction ends when it is committed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transactions must be atomic, all operations in a transaction must be able to be completed (or none of them will be applied).</li>
  <li>A transaction must maintain all the integrity rules of a database, known as consistency.</li>
  <li>Transaction data must be isolated, data used during one transaction cannot be used by a second until the first is committed.</li>
  <li><strong>Once transactions are committed they can not be undone</strong>, this is called durability.</li>
</ul>

<p>A DBMS stores all transactions into a transaction log.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Controlling multiple users requesting the same resource at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Concurrency control ensures users can not impact each other. Each transaction should be <strong>serializable</strong>, a property allowing concurrent transactions to produce the same final state. This presents some challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lost updates: one concurrent transaction is lost, and the final state only reflects the other transaction.</li>
  <li>Uncommitted data: one transaction rolling back after another concurrent transaction has accessed the uncommitted data.</li>
  <li>Inconsistent retrieval: transactions reading data at different times allowing one transaction to “miss” changes to data as they happen.</li>
</ul>

<p>A DBMS has a scheduler to execute transactions at different time to ensure serializability and isolation. Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">locks</code> we can guarantee exclusive access to an item within a concurrent transaction. A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lock manager</code> is responsible to assign the properties of each lock. Locks can be applied to a database, table, page, row, or field.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Locks are only unlocked once a transaction is finished (committed or rolled back)</li>
  <li>Page locks’ lock partitions of a database that are stored in disk blocks. Many disk blocks (of a physical disk) may be used to store a table, when one transaction accesses information in a block the entire block is locked until the transaction is finished.</li>
  <li>When two transactions try to access a locked resource by one another we get a deadlock, where both transactions infinitely wait for each other to unlock the resource.</li>
</ul>
