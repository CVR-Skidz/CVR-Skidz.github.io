This is the first entry made after migrating from my own web server to jekyll, so I thought I would write a post instead of the regular pages I write.

This site serves as a collection of notes and information I have written on a variety of computer science, mathematics, and tehcnolgoical subjects. Currently there is a roughly even split between topics taken from university papers and those I have covered personally. Topics are hopefully written as clearly as possible. I expect the layout of the site to change over time as I try to frakenstien some elements like page contents and searching together. With that being said I hope you find some useful information.
