## About Me
Since February of 2019 I have been studying computer science at Auckland's University of Technology. With a focus on systems, embedded, and artificial intelligence development I write simple, fast, and clean code for humans. Otherwise I am also interested in computer graphics and virtualisation, as well as normal people things...

Below you will find my publicly available work. [Here](README) you can also find all my writings on numerous topics related to computer science.
